🌀 Editable Maze Game
Welcome to the Editable Maze Game repository! 🎮


This project is a fun and interactive application that allows users to design and play their own maze games.
With customizable layouts, smooth gameplay, and intuitive controls, it’s perfect for maze enthusiasts and creators alike!

So Long is a Curriculum 42 project involving the development of a 2D game in which the player must collect objects and reach an exit in a labyrinth. 
One of the project's main technical challenges is to use the backtracking algorithm to validate the feasibility of the levels.

Thanks to backtracking, the program verifies that each proposed map has a valid path to collect all the objects and reach the exit, thus guaranteeing a coherent and functional gaming experience. This project focuses on event management, algorithmic logic and creativity.
